#Intro to Networks Project 3 (Distance Vector Routing)

The original, unmodified submission for Intro to Networks Project 3, which required one to construct router programs that communicate to each other using UDP packets and determine the shortest path to each router given the current cost of each connection in the network.

The docs folder contains the original problem statement (P3.pdf) as well as the original report submission, which contains pictures of all the test cases as well as a video of the program in action.

This repository is made available for others to take a look at.
